# 2D mmo/mud

### in short
A python based in browser mmo with ascii based graphics.
The world is "round" and populated by islands with npc characters on them.

### these features already work
- A seed based generation for islands, npcs and monsters
- Multiplayer support with pvp, chat and trading
- Harvesting resources such as woodcutting and mining
- Buying and selling items from stores
- Storing earned money to banks
- A wear system, including armor, ships and weapons
- Adding additional items, resources, enemies, npcs is easy with the config file
- Multiple servernode support and a centralized login server with database connection to save gamestate
- food to recover health, harvesting and buying it



### these are under construction
- dungeons, they kinda work, but they don't contain anything functional

### future ideas
- i gave up and restarted on something bigger and better


### Dependencies (python3 modules)
- argon2-cffi
- websocket & websocket-client
- psycopg2-binary
- tornado
