### in short
A python based in browser mmo with ascii based graphics.
The world is "round" and populated by islands with npc characters on them.

### game systems that have been somewhat implemented
- A seed based generation for islands, npcs and monsters
- Multiplayer support with pvp, chat and trading
- Harvesting resources such as woodcutting and mining
- Buying and selling items from stores
- Storing earned money to banks
- A wear system, including armor, ships and weapons
- Adding additional items, resources, enemies, npcs is easy with the config file



### in progress
- saving gamestate to a database
- multiple server support, all of which connect to a central database to sync player progress between servers


### todo
- weapons for ships
- different types of shops, each specializing in specific item types etc
- different types of areas such as civilized and monster populated areas, restrict specific npc and monster types to these areas
- map that shows positions of islands and the types of the areas, possibly represented by assigning 1 pixel to 1 tile
- islands that are larger than one gametile?
